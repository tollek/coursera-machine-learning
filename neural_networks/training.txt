TRAINING STEPS:

1. pick the network architecture
   - input, output -> defined by the problem
   - hidden layers; if h > 1, each hidden should have same # of nodes
   - # hidden layer nodes ~ N * # input layer nodes (N = 2, 3, 4)

2. training:
  
   1. initialize Theta
   2. for each input sample (x_i, y_i):
      a. forward propagation
      b. compute J(Theta)
      c. backprop - computer deltas
      d. compute cumulative deltas
   3. compute dJ/dTheta
   4. (optional) gradient checking to compare dJ/dTheta to numerical estimate
      once you're sure it's OK, disable gradient checking
   5. use gradient descent or advanced optimization method
      with backprop to try to minimize J(Theta)
